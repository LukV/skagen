        "abstract": "In the digital era, social media usage has become an integral part of daily life, particularly among adolescents. This study investigates the relationship between anxiety, loneliness, sleep disorders, and social media addiction among adolescents. A cross-sectional study involving 290 X and XI-grade students utilized standardized instruments: the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS/SRAS), UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Bivariate analysis was conducted using the Chi-square test (p&lt;0.05). Findings revealed 10.7% severe social media addiction, 21.4% severe anxiety, 4.8% significant loneliness, and 74.5% poor sleep quality. Significant associations were found between anxiety (p=0.013), loneliness (p=0.010), sleep disturbance (p=0.033), and social media addiction. Higher anxiety, loneliness, and poor sleep quality correlate with increased susceptibility to social media addiction among adolescents. This underscores the importance of addressing psychological well-being in interventions aimed at mitigating social media addiction",

        "abstract": "Social media is a popular form of communication and entertainment among youth. Inconsistencies are present in the literature on the potential effects it can have on mental health. Depression and anxiety disorders are common among all age groups in the US, and this study aimed to determine the relationship social media has on symptoms of anxiety and depression. The Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS) and the GAD-7 were used to measure symptoms of anxiety, as well as the CES-D scale to evaluate depressive symptoms in adolescents. The number of social networking sites and number of hours spent on social media are two variables that measure social media usage and were analyzed among a sample of Communities In Schools (CIS) students. The majority of the sample identified as persons of color and were considered to be of low socioeconomic status according to the district guidelines. An exploratory study using a single measurement, correlational design was conducted to explore the relationship between social media and mental health, and a survey was completed among CIS students in four middle schools and two high school in a local school district (N=84). Several linear regression analyses were conducted to analyze the variance in scores on the SAS, GAD-7, and CESD scales as explained by social media factors. The findings show that the amount of time spent on social media and symptoms of depression were significantly related to one another, yet there appeared to be no relationship between symptoms of anxiety and social media usage",

        "abstract": "This study examines social media's quantitative effect on juvenile criminality. The researcher intends to quantify how\n          social media usage affects juvenile delinquency. The research will examine mediating elements, including peer\n          influence, self-esteem, and antisocial content. This study may educate parents, educators, politicians, and mental\n          health experts on adolescent social media usage hazards. This study aims to establish evidence-based social media\n          mitigation and youth development solutions. This research employed quantitative methodologies. The target population\n          for this study will be two hundred (200) criminology students of Headstart College of Cotabato. Participants will be\n          selected using a time-efficient random selection strategy. The findings of a power analysis will be used to calculate the\n          sample size needed to achieve the desired level of statistical significance. The researcher will administer the survey\n          questionnaire face-to-face after proper coordination with the College head. Respondents had enough time to complete\n          the survey questions. The researcher and respondents will complete the questionnaire in their own time to gather and\n          retrieve data: data quantification, categorization, and statistical description. Weighted mean and correlation were\n          utilized to assess the association between social media use and teenage delinquency and behavior. The researcher\n          carried out all methods using SPSS Application Guide as statistical software. The study revealed that excessive social\n          media use is associated with negative outcomes such as mental health issues, decreased social interactions, and\n          potential impacts on academic performance. Additionally, the level of parental monitoring and communication regarding\n          social media usage was varied, and family conflict related to social media use was evident to some extent. There needs\n          to be more research done to determine the mechanisms that link adolescent social media usage and behavior.\n          Longitudinal studies may help explain what happens and why, as well as suggest any necessary countermeasures",

        "abstract": "This article explores the potentially negative psychological effects social media photo-sharing platforms have on America’s adolescents. While most studies on mental health effects related to social media use have focused on Facebook and the young adult age group 18-35, this article focuses on users under the age of 18 with an emphasis on Instagram and Snapchat – the two most rapidly growing social networking sites for adolescents. Photo-sharing sites have characteristics different than other social media sites, specifically the ability to alter photos and to communicate live time through videos and photos, which may have different mental health consequences on younger populations. Through a review of previous academic research, and a survey administered to a sample population under the age of 18, this article analyzes how social comparisons, a need for external validation, and a fear of missing out and exclusion may affect adolescents more than older adults due to the fact that they are in a critical developmental period where self-esteem and self-worth can be particularly influenced by peers and social media. While some argue that social media, including photo-sharing sites, may allow adolescents more social contact, opportunities for self-esteem building, and a chance for those who are shy or with low self-esteem to experiment in a safer environment than face to face contact, this article shows that the opposite is also true: that excessive use of photo-sharing sites may lead to negative mental health consequences due to social comparisons, a fear of missing out, and an unhealthy desire to attain external validation from peers. The article also suggests that adolescents with deceptive personalities, Machiavellian personalities, and high social desirability needs may be more vulnerable to some of the risks of social media use, and that identifying at-risk individuals may allow teachers, counselors, and parents to help them navigate their social media world during an influential time in their lives",

        "abstract": "The global increase in popularity and accessibility to social media platforms daily, University students in Nigeria, like their counterparts worldwide, are facing unique challenges related to their mental well-being caused by media addiction despite the fact that technology has drastically and dramatically transformed the clinical delivery of mental health services globally in the recent times. However, the relationship between this transformation- social media and the mental health among the University students in Nigeria cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, this paper systematically reviewed the social media addiction and the mental health of the Nigerian University students. It further reviewed and emphasized the good aspect of social media on mental health, the negative effects it has, and the addiction (ugly) developed in the course of using social media. Studies were reviewed to juxtapose the good, bad and the ugly of the use and its influence on mental health of Nigerian students. The paper concluded that, though, social media has contributed significantly to the modern dissemination of clinical delivery but its addiction, could negatively affect the mental health of the students as many studies have established. Therefore, there is a need for a balanced approach to social media usage for this population to have and sustain better mental health because the less they are addicted to social media the better the mental health of the Nigerian students.&nbsp",

Semi-structured interviews, based on interpretive phenomenological analysis, were utilized with six pairs of individuals resulting in 12 total participants. Each pair consisted of an adolescent between the ages of 13 and 17 along with their parent. Data analysis resulted in three themes: encountering negativity on social media did not refrain the adolescent from social media usage, misunderstanding of the parent regarding social media and technology caused challenges in parental monitoring, and the quality of time spent together differed in the perception of the adolescent participants and parent participants. The findings of this study suggest that even though participant pairs reported encountering negativity on social media, they continue to use social media, and parent participants are unaware of the amount of time their adolescent spends on social media, which could be contributed to the lack of quality time they spend with one another. The findings of this research add to the current literature regarding social media and the impact it has on the parent-adolescent relationship among at-risk youth",

Social media has become increasingly popular among young adults, with some spending over 10 hours each day on social media. Social media can be utilized for community building, fostering relationships, providing safe spaces, inspiration, creative expression, and may even provide users with acceptance, validation, and a sense of belonging. Considering these factors, social media may also affect individuals negatively— specifically mental health-wise, in terms of anxiety and depression. This study aimed to identify whether a correlation exists between time spent on social media and anxiety and/or depression levels, as well as distinguish a correlation between type of user, passive user or active user, and anxiety and/or depression levels. Results showed no significant influence of both type of user and hours of use on participants’ anxiety and depression levels. Future studies may conduct a longitudinal qualitative study to achieve in-depth and causal results, as well as include the context of social media content, users’ life factors affecting mental health outside of the internet, and mental health history",

        "abstract": "Social media addiction is fundamentally evaluated as a behavioral addiction. The studies on this issue stress the relation of long-term social media usage that may transform into addiction with chronical stress, depression, low psychological well-being and decreased life satisfaction. This study aims to examine the relationship between psychological resilience and coping skills of young adults and their levels of social media addiction. Participants of the study consists of total 436 young adults, 296 (68%) of which are female and 140 (32%) of which are male. “Social Media Addiction Scale”, “The Brief Resilience Scale” and “COPE Inventory- Brief Form” are applied to the participants. The results indicated that mean scores of social media addiction scales show low levels of social media addiction by the participants. According to multiple regression analysis results, psychological resilience, acceptance, substance use, focusing on and venting of emotions, and turning to religion have significant effect on predicting social media addiction. Psychological resilience is a predictor of social media addiction in negative direction. On the other hand, there is a relationship between emotion-oriented and unfunctional coping strategies and social media addiction",

        "abstract": "Emergent research suggests that “fear of missing out” (FoMO)-driven nocturnal use of social media may result in sleep disturbances and adversely influence quality of sleep. Previous research in this area primarily focused on adolescents. Therefore, knowledge of these occurrences in young adults is limited. This study addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the associations of FoMO, psychological well-being (anxiety, depression), compulsive social media use (CSMU), and sleep hygiene (habits that promote/inhibit sleep) with problematic sleep adults in both academic and employment settings. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted to collect data from two cohorts including (i) full-time students (N = 1398), and (ii) full-time working professionals (N = 472). Data were analyzed with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that psychological well-being influences CSMU, which in concurrence with sleep habits, influences the association between FoMO and problematic sleep. Significant differences existed in the strength of the association between CSMU and FoMO between the two cohorts. Interestingly, FoMO is more strongly associated with CSMU among working professionals. This study provides novel insights into the differential effects of CSMU and FoMO on sleep behaviors in young adult students versus working professionals.publishedVersio",
